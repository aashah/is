- A lot of this code is derived from the practices used by the golang team for
	implementing `go get` This includes their approach towards handling
	subcommands (such as get, build...etc) as well as their approach on creating
	and updating code retrieved from version control systems.
- Much of the code has been adapted to meet our needs, but the base structures
	are very close. More on the golang approach can be found at
	http://code.google.com/p/go
