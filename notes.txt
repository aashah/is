Things that need to be done/considered

Where downloaded packages should be stored
	- Take this in as an argument or rely on an environment variable
	- I think the project is getting large enough to move it into an env var

- help(), usage() and proper exiting

- how to traverse a git repository
	- moving to support other kinds of repositories

- An SDK version manager might be pretty cool, would help manage the
	environment variables and maintaining backwards compatibility to a degree
	- For now, best to rely on certain env variables

- Variables:
	- INTERFACESDKROOT - indicates the root directory of the exhibit
		- this may have been created by the ./interfacesdksetup.sh script
		- file structure of root:
			/root
				/development
					/modules
				/sources
					/modules
					/interface_sdk
