Things that need to be done/considered

COMMAND LINE STRUCTURE:
Prefix: is
Subcommands: {
	get: [-v verbose] [-c check/validate module] [modules]
	mv: [-v verbose] [-c check/validate] [directories]
	run: [-v verbose]
}

Since we take over how modules will be stored, we need a command to handle
moving preexisting modules over to our file structure
	- can validate modules too

Where downloaded packages should be stored
	- Take this in as an argument or rely on an environment variable
	- I think the project is getting large enough to move it into an env var

- help(), usage() and proper exiting

- how to traverse a git repository
	- moving to support other kinds of repositories

- An SDK version manager might be pretty cool, would help manage the
	environment variables and maintaining backwards compatibility to a degree
	- For now, best to rely on certain env variables

- Variables:
	- INTERFACESDKROOT - indicates the root directory of the exhibit
		- this may have been created by the ./interfacesdksetup.sh script
		- file structure of root (as created by the setup script):
			/root
				/development
					/modules
				/sources
					/modules
					/interface_sdk
