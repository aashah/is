Things that need to be considered

- What to do about modules that belong to users that don't have a github?
	- Should they still follow some convention like:
		$INTERFACESDKROOT/sources/modules/{user}/{module}
	- This concerns `is mv` not `is get`

- An SDK version manager might be pretty cool, would help manage the
	environment variables and maintaining backwards compatibility to a degree
	- For now, best to rely on certain env variables

- Variables:
	- INTERFACESDKROOT - indicates the root directory of the exhibit
		- this may have been created by the ./interfacesdksetup.sh script
		- file structure of root (as created by the setup script):
			/root
				/development
					/modules
				/sources
					/modules
					/interface_sdk
